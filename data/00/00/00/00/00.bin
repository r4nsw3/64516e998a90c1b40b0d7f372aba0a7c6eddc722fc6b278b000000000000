  |   Fantasy Strike is a colorful fighting game where fantasy meets        |
  |   martial arts. It focuses on depth and strategy rather than            |
  |   difficult execution. It's designed for tournament play, but also to   |
  |   welcome you to the genre if you haven't played other fighting games   |
  |   before. Online play uses the excellent GGPO networking technology.    |
  |   Includes several single player modes.                                 |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update/Patch Notes: v17874 (v393216) - Firmware: 8.1.0 / Mkey 7.0.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * This month, we have lots of bug fixes for you, all aimed at         |
  |     making things work even more smoothly. There is a new feature for   |
  |     music that allows you to sit in silence in the menus while          |
  |     waiting for an online match, but then still have music when you     |
  |     actually play. Also, Setsuki has one balance change, that fixes     |
  |     an accidentally-too-good thing about her air C (Flying Fox) that    |
  |     she's had for the last few months                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * ONLINE                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * If your Master Rank changes when the tournament ends, the score     |
  |     screen now shows the change correctly. It used to wrongly show      |
  |     your same rank on this screen only (and update everywhere else)     |
  |     if your rank changed                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * After spectating a ranked match, you now correctly see your own     |
  |     player data on various UI screens such as the rank shown in the     |
  |     online play menu. Before, you'd wrongly see the data of the         |
  |     player you previously spectated                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Now we actually show the correct player names on the character      |
  |     roulette screen when spectating a friend match involving a team     |
  |     battle                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * In the rematch menu for casual online matches, if you choose        |
  |     "Next opponent", your opponent now immediately moves on, rather     |
  |     than waiting for the full 10 second countdown to finish. We now     |
  |     realize this bug has been happening for the last 10 months. Now     |
  |     fixed                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * [Switch] Fixed a serious bug accidentally introduced last patch     |
  |     that occurred when playing a second (or more) ranked match per      |
  |     session. When you did, the character roulette screen would          |
  |     sometimes suddenly send you to the main menu, ending the match,     |
  |     or perhaps send you to a black screen forever if your opponent      |
  |     suffered the "sent to main menu" bug. (Note, this was hotfixed      |
  |     already on Steam/PS4, but Nintendo Switch patches take up to 20     |
  |     days for approval so for that period of time, the Switch version    |
  |     had this serious problem. Thankfully Valve and Sony allow for       |
  |     immediate patches.)                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * When your previously-sent challenge gets accepted right after you   |
  |     would start a casual online or ranked online game, during the       |
  |     short "Here comes a new challenger" animation, we now drop the      |
  |     challenge and continue with your queued online match. The queued    |
  |     match got there first. This fixes you getting stuck in a black      |
  |     screen, your casual online opponent having their online match       |
  |     interrupted as it starts, and your friend match opponent being      |
  |     set in a silent bad state where mysterious bad things happen        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * MISC                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New music option. In addition to music on or off, there is now      |
  |     "gameplay only". When this is set, there will not be music in the   |
  |     menus, but there will be music in gameplay. An example use of       |
  |     this is idling (in silence) in the menus while you wait for an      |
  |     online match, while getting to hear music during your actual        |
  |     match                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Setsuki's air C (Flying Fox) has a little more upward force. This   |
  |     fixes an issue accidentally introduced many months ago that         |
  |     allowed Setsuki to do air C towards the opponent, let it finish,    |
  |     then do it again (the same direction) and be so low that she        |
  |     cancelled the rest of the move by landing and ended up at +12 on    |
  |     block. In much older builds, she would pull up at the end which     |
  |     made her unsafe, rather than land instantly. This change restores   |
  |     it to more like it was meant to be. Note that if you want to make   |
  |     the opponent block air C, then have a lot of frame advantage, you   |
  |     still can. Just do air C -> A (divekick). But this sequence         |
  |     triggers only one point of flashing block damage (from the air      |
  |     C), rather than two (from air C x 2). Alternatively, you can        |
  |     STILL do air C -> air C and end up at frame advantage, but only     |
  |     if you do it from a precise, far away distance or if you do it      |
  |     from close on the way down from a jump. Either way, you can no      |
  |     longer repeat that sequence as a lockdown                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a bug with the tutorial dummies in the section about          |
  |     combos. When you press B to combo a projectile into them, if you    |
  |     happened to hold B for a certain number of frames, the dummy        |
  |     would have no hitbox and the projectile would pass through. Rare    |
  |     because of the specific timing involved, but now fixed              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed buggy controls for the top-right menu when on the 1p          |
  |     character select screen (e.g. Arcade Mode's character select)       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * [Steam] Fixed a bug on the friends list screen where dropdown       |
  |     menus could appear partially off screen at certain resolution       |
  |     settings                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * [Switch] When using detached joycons, pressing the analog stick     |
  |     in no longer calls the Friends screen                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * [Steam] Fixed a category of bad states when you use a secondary     |
  |     monitor and attempt to use a fullscreen resolution that's not       |
  |     supported for that monitor. (Instead of getting stuck in a loop     |
  |     of either refreshing the list of resolutions every frame (merely    |
  |     breaks the resolution dropdown UI), or remembering an incorrect     |
  |     resolution for next launch, or actually setting an incorrect        |
  |     resolution every frame (disaster!), the game now accepts the        |
  |     resulting lower resolution than what it attempted to set.)          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a memory leak with arcade mode. This particular issue also    |
  |     caused the game to crash if the leak happened, then you later       |
  |     entered arcade mode again                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a crash that could happen when DeGrey's ghost deals block     |
  |     damage that wins the round (meaning, when the opponent loses        |
  |     their last hit point to this block damage)                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a camera bug introduced last patch where the camera would     |
  |     not scroll up enough when both characters jumped. Now reverted to   |
  |     how it always was                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed a camera bug introduced last patch having to do with moves    |
  |     that briefly lock the camera in place. This issue was barely        |
  |     noticeable in most cases, except for Setsuki's B ninjaport          |
  |     kick/throw, where the camera issue was very noticeable and buggy    |
  |     (too jerky)                                                         |
